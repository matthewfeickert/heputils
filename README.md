# heputils

Helper utilities around the Scikit-HEP ecosystem for common tasks in HEP

**This library is not meant for wide use and will probably be deprecated in favor of [`scikit-hep`](https://github.com/scikit-hep/scikit-hep) soon.**
This library should be viewed as a testing grounds for API design decisions, hence it will not be put up on PyPI.

## Installation

In a fresh virtual environment

```
$ python -m pip install "git+https://github.com/matthewfeickert/heputils.git"
```

The above is actually cloning and installing directly from the Git repository.
However, if you want to, you can of course also install it directly from the Git repository "locally" by first cloning the repo and then from the top level of it running

```
$ python -m pip install .
```
